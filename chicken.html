    <h1>BBQ Chicken</h1>
    <p>
      Nice crispy chicken, with tangy taste. It is best if bone-in chicken
      pieces used.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups cider vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons poultry seasoning</li>
      <li>2 pounds cut up chicken pieces</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat grill to medium heat.</li>
      <li>
        In a small skillet combine the oil, vinegar, salt and pepper and put
        over low heat. Add the poultry seasoning while stirring constantly; when
        sauce mixes well and starts to bubble, it is done.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken on hot grill and brush with sauce. Grill for 45 to 60
        minutes, turning every 5 to 10 minutes, and brush chicken with sauce
        after each turning. Grill until chicken is done and juices run clear.
        (Note: Be sure to keep an eye on the chicken as it cooks, as it tends to
        have flair ups due to the oil and chicken drippings!)
